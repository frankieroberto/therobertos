  <p class="intro">Hello. We got married on 30th June 2012. Thanks to all those that came!</p>

  <p>We had a great time, despite the occasional torrential downpour, and loved the location.</p>

  <p>Our favourite memories of the day include the rained-off rounders match, standing around the log fire, beating the pi√±ata, and lighting sparklers at midnight. But most of all we loved being surrounded by friends and family from near and afar.</p>
