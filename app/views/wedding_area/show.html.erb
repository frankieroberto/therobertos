    <h1>The Area</h1>
  </header>

  <p class="intro">The Wedding is within the Snowdonia region of North Wales, a spectacular National Park filled with mountain ranges and valleys. There's plenty to see and do nearby, and so we can highly recommend staying a bit longer and making a holiday of it, if you fancy it.</p>

<h2>Snowdon</h2>

<p>The highest mountain in England and Wales, Snowdon, lies immediately North-West of the campsite. The closest path up is the Watkins Path, which starts just a couple of miles down the road, between Llyn Dinas and Llyn Gywnant. For a less demanding ascent, drive around to Pen-y-Pass and follow either the Miners or Pyg tracks. For an even easier ascent, there is a small steam train which climbs to the top, starting over in Llanberis.</p>
