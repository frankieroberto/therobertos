<h2>Snowdon</h2>

<p>The highest mountain in England and Wales, Snowdon, lies immediately North-West of the campsite. The closest path up is the Watkins Path, which starts just a couple of miles down the road, between Llyn Dinas and Llyn Gywnant. For a less demanding ascent, drive around to Pen-y-Pass and follow either the Miners or Pyg tracks. For an even easier ascent, there is a small steam train which climbs to the top, starting over in Llanberis.</p>

<h2>Canoeing and Kayaking</h2>

<p>The lake by the campsite is a popular spot for watersports, and you can <a href="http://www.gwynant.com/pages/information/boats.html">hire</a> kayaks (single or double) and Canadian canoes by the hour at around £5 per person. <a href="http://www.gwynant.com/pages/information/activities.html">Tuition</a> is also available from Bob Marchant, at £35 per person per half-day. Both can be either booked in advance, or arrange on the day.</p>

<h2>Rock Climbing</h2>

<p>For the adventurous, there are plenty of locations nearby in which you can go rock climbing, bouldering or scrambling.</p>

<h2>Welsh Highland Railway</h2>

<p>Newly restored, the <a href="http://www.festrail.co.uk/main.shtml">Welsh Highland Railway</a> is a historic narrow-gauge steam railway that operates from Porthmadog to Caernarfon, with several stops along the route, including in the nearby Beddgelert. The line offers many scenic views, and includes the rocky Aberglaslyn Pass gorge, incorporating several narrow tunnels.</p>
