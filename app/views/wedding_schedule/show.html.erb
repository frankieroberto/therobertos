<h1>Schedule</h1>

<p class="intro">The wedding ceremony took place at 3pm, performed by a local registrar in the main barn itself.</p>

<p>The ceremony was followed by champagne and canapés - including bara brith and smoked salmon blinis.</p>

<p>We then had a game of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounders">rounders</a> in the field, which was abandoned mid-way through the second innings when the weather dramatically turned from sun to a torrential downpour.</p>

<p>After a quick drying-off around the log fire (and in some cases a change of clothes), we took turns to beat a sweet-filled Mexican piñata.</p>

<p>Dinner was at 6PM - lamb and vegetable tagines followed by a choice of desserts.</p>

<p>There were some short after-dinner speeches, and then dancing, drinking and chatting until midnight.</p>
